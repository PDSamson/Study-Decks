##Introduction##

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I built this application using ReactJS and Ajax to facilitate http requests.  This flashcard application allows users to build decks of flashcards that they can use to study any subject they desire.  I built this application to practice my React and Rails skills, the latter specifically for building nested resources.

Resources can only be accessed by the user that created them.
